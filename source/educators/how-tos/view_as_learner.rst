After you have published content, you should view it in the LMS, as a learner will.

#. In the course outline, click :guilabel:`View Live`.

   The course opens in the LMS, in a new tab.

#. Go through the content you created and check for accuracy.  You can edit the content in Studio, then publish your changes, to fix any issues.
